# TODO

Features remaining to implement
 - export slice data to ink file full of variables with image coords
    - if metadata is specified (knot or display text), use as hovertext
 - maybe selectively choose which layers to export for a given tag?
 - probably doesn't need to actually flatten the layers, technically.
